# 👋 Hi, I'm Stephan

I'm a backend developer who enjoys building stable, well-structured systems with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, and clean architecture principles.  
Over the years I've worked across different areas, but my focus today is firmly on **backend engineering**, API design, and solid software fundamentals.

## 🔧 Tech Focus
- **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **NestJS**, **Express**
- **REST API design**, clean architecture, dependency injection
- **Docker**, GitHub Actions, DevOps awareness
- **SQL / NoSQL**, MongoDB

## 🚀 What I build
I focus on backend systems that are reliable, clear, and maintainable:
- Authentication & security-aware modules  
- Microservices with separation of concerns  
- Well-structured REST APIs  
- Learning projects aimed at improving architecture and code quality  

## 📂 Featured Projects
- **Unwritten Legends – Auth & Dashboard Microservices**  
  Authentication module + status dashboard built as two independent microservices.

- **CourseManager API – TypeScript Backend Showcase**  
  Clean TypeScript architecture with services, controllers, manual validation and unit tests.

- **DevOps Final Project – Local Infrastructure Setup**  
  A practical DevOps-oriented environment with Docker, CI, and Kubernetes basics.

## 💡 Philosophy
I value clarity over complexity, strong typing over guesswork, and building systems that last.  
Security thinking, clean code, and predictable behavior guide how I write my backend services.

Feel free to explore my repositories — always improving, always building.
