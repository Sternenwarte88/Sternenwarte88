# Hey, welcome to my GitHub profile! 👋

I'm a passionate software developer who loves blending new technologies together.  
For the past three years, I've been diving deep into Unity 🎮, mastering C#, dependency injection, and Message Pipe. Since January, I've been expanding my horizons in an exciting DevOps training—Python, Jenkins, Git workflows, Docker, and Kubernetes are now part of my everyday toolkit 🐳.

## My Passion: Backend Development 💡

While I enjoy exploring various tech domains, my heart beats strongest for creating robust backends. Here’s my favorite stack in action:

- **MongoDB:** For flexible and scalable data storage 🗃️  
- **Express:** A minimalist framework for building fast and efficient APIs ⚡  
- **React:** For crafting dynamic, modern frontends that engage users 🔥  
- **Node.js:** A high-performance runtime that seamlessly ties the stack together 🔗

I love developing innovative solutions and building projects that not only shine technically but also deliver real value 🚀.

Feel free to explore my projects—let's build something great together! 🤝
