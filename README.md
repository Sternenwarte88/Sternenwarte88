### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Stephan and born in June 1988 in Germany. Around May I started to learn MERN and done some smaller code along projects in my lessons and started to write 2 smaller projects on my self. 

Feel free to take a look around, but please, be aware that I'm at the start on my journey. There is so much fun and to learn in this Javascript World :D
